# SlugfyBinaryMask - Image to string functions to WebHigiia

This repository contain the main functions to convert a binary image (mask/overlay) into a compacted, base64 string that can be stored as a BLOB into a relational DBMS.
Compression algorithm is z-lib implemented by the Qt-SDK.

# Background technologies and 3rd-party libraries

Siren relies on a series of background technologies and 3rd-party libraries to work properly, namely:

1. Background technologies

- [Qt SDK][qt] - Qt Cross-Platform and SDK C++ development environment.

2. 3rd-party libraries

- [Hermes][hermes] - Our own C++ library of distance functions (and utils).
- [Artemis][artemis] - Our own wrapper library for images (and utils).
- [Dicomlib][dicomlib] - The classical self-contained Trevor Morgan dicomlib library from Google Code Archive (We were able to compile it with brand new Emscripten ðŸ˜€ - Classic codes die hard).
- [Boost][boost] - A few (self-contained) Boost header files (without the need for compiling the entire library) - wasm-compliant.
- [Eigen][eigen] - A few (self-contained) Eigen header files (without the need for compiling the entire library) - wasm-compliant.


## Installation

Install the background technologies and download the source code of 3rd-party libraries.
Then, adjust the include paths of `slug.pro.example` file to point to the installation folders of the 3rd-party libraries and rename it to `slug.pro`.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
/Qt/5.15.1/gcc_64/bin/qmake   #for desktop-binary building
```


Then, run the following command.

```sh
cd SlugfyBinaryMask
make && make clean
```

## Routines

1. readAndCompressMask(std::string imageFileName) - Read and compress a binary PNG image.

2.  uncompressMask(QString zipStr) - Read a QString and uncompress it to an (Artemis) Image.
